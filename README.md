Explanation of the Code:
Array Initialization (string[] arr) :
We define an array of strings called arr, where each string ends with a number (e.g., "apple1", "cherry2", "banana3").
Concatenating Strings :
We initialize a nullable string constring to null.
In the foreach loop, we concatenate each string from the array arr to constring.
Since constring starts as null, the first iteration will make constring equal to the first string in the array. Subsequent iterations will append the remaining strings.
Printing the Concatenated String :
After the loop, constring will contain all the strings concatenated together. In this case, it will be "apple1cherry2banana3".
We print this concatenated string to the console.
Finding Numbers in the String :
We create a new list of integers called ae to store the numbers found in the concatenated string.
We loop through numbers from 0 to 8 (inclusive). For each number i, we check if the concatenated string constring contains the number as a substring using constring.Contains(i.ToString()).
If the number is found in the string, we add it to the list ae.
Finding Maximum and Minimum Values :
After populating the list ae with the numbers found in the string, we use the Max() and Min() methods from the System.Linq namespace to find the largest and smallest numbers in the list, respectively.
Finally, we print the maximum and minimum values to the console.
Example Output:
Given the input array {"apple1", "cherry2", "banana3"}, the output will be:
apple1cherry2banana3
MAX Value: 3
MIN Value: 1
Key Points:
The foreach loop concatenates all strings in the array into a single string.
The for loop checks for numbers from 0 to 8 in the concatenated string and adds them to a list if found.
The Max() and Min() methods are used to find the largest and smallest numbers in the list of found numbers.
